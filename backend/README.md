# Whatsapp Web Clone Backend

This is a backend service that implements WebSocket protocol to communicate with the [Whatsapp Web Clone UI](https://github.com/KarenOk/whatsapp-web-clone) I previously built.

Built using Express and Socket.IO

## Steps to run

- Install dependencies with the command `npm install`
- Start the server with the command `npm run start`
- This application should start running on `http://localhost:5000/`. Run the [Whatsapp Web Clone UI](https://github.com/KarenOk/whatsapp-web-clone#readme) together with this service to see it in action.
